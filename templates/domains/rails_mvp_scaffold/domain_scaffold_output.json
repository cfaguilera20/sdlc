Identify which subdomain(s) the ticket touches\n2. Run the appropriate Domain Expert agent(s) using the template files\n3. Collect the `DomainKnowledgePack` JSON output(s)\n4. Use the pack(s) as input to Agent 02 (Product Analyst) for backlog generation\n\n## Example Files\n\nSee `examples/` directory for example `DomainKnowledgePack` JSONs that demonstrate the expected structure and content for each subdomain.\n",

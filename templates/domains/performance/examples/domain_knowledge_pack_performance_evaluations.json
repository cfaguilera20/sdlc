    "Evaluation is reopened for correction - system maintains history, allows edits within time window",
    "Multiple evaluators provide conflicting scores - system flags discrepancies, may require calibration or manager review",
    "Evaluation cycle is extended - system updates deadlines, notifies participants, adjusts phase timelines",
    "Employee changes roles mid-cycle - system handles role change, may require new evaluation or continuation",
    "Evaluation data is corrupted - system maintains backups, allows recovery from last valid state"

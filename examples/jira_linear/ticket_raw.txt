[Jira] PROJ-123 — Fix student SSO email mismatch

Problem:
Students sign in with <student_id>@dpsprivate.com but Entra returns <student_id>@daltonk12.onmicrosoft.com.
We need consistent linking so existing Thrillshare/FusionAuth users can authenticate.

Constraints:
- Do not change existing email in Thrillshare
- Must support both domains during transition
- Must avoid account takeover

Acceptance:
- Student can login regardless of which email Entra returns
- Existing accounts are linked to correct user
- Audit trail for link events
